# current-status

I am currently working on Java and other related course on Udemy.com. The Java course alone is 80 hours of video plus exercise content and I want to spend my time working towards completing this course to build a better foundation for my skills and knowledge before returning here. Once I have completed the Java and maybe the Spring course I will reevaluate where I want to set my focus.
